This is the repo for the HTML course from developertraining.io
It's broken into modules, with all but the first module having a Start and a Done folder.
The Start folder of the next module (in general) contains the contents of the Done folder
from the previous module. This is by design; in the event that your files are so far off the path,
it will help you in at least starting fresh on the next module.
You will do your work in the Start folder; it should match very closely to the contents of the Done folder when you are done.
