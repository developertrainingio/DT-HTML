    <h2>Divs and Spans</h2>
    <p> <em>The next two sections really shine when combined with CSS.</em></p>
      <h3>Div</h3>
<p> Divs allow you to separate the different parts of our web page when
  there <em>isn't</em> an existing tag that will do the job (e.g. aside, section, nav, etc.).</p>

<div class = "musicians">
<h2>My Photos of Musicians</h2>
<img src = "images/me_cello.jpg" alt = "Me and my cello" / width = "50%" height = "50%">
<img src = "images/rayandersonpjc.jpg" alt = "Ray Anderson - Jazz Trombonist" width = "50%" height = "50%" />
</div> <!-- End musicians div -->

<div class = "logos">
<h2>Logos I've designed</h2>
<img src = "images/AOMLogo.jpg" alt = "agentsofmad logo" / width = "50%" height = "50%">
<img src = "images/dt_logo.png" alt = "developer training logo" width = "50%" height = "50%" />
</div> <!-- End logos div -->
      <h3>Span</h3>
<p> Compared to a div, which separates things into logical sections, span tags are used to highlight a special part
  of a paragraph, similar to a quote, but allowing for a lot more flexibility in what you highlight.<p>
    <p>In this course, which focuses on HTML only, span tags don't appear to do anything. That's because this tag
    is really designed to work hand in hand with <span class = "css">CSS </span> and classes. </p>

    <h2> Code</h2>
<p> When you need to display some sort of code to be typed</p>
  <code>
      <p> This is sample code. It is in a monospaced font.</p>
  </code>

    <h2> HTML Symbols and Emojis</h2>
<p> Similar to our copyright symbol, emojis are a part of the UTF-8 character encoding set. As long as we have that meta tag in the head, we should be just fine.<br>
  A list of emojis and their codes can be found at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_emoji.asp">https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_emoji.asp</a></p>

    <h2>Canvas</h2>
    <p>Like Divs and Spans, Canvas really works better when combined with something else. However, it's NOT CSS. Rather, it's JavaScript,
      the third part of the Web Design Trinity.</p>
      <canvas>
<h3>This is creating a canvas</h3>
<p>It doesn't really do anything without JavaScript, though. JavaScript can be used to draw graphics on the fly, inside of
  this canvas element.</p>
  <p> At this point, this is equivalent to a "White Polar bear in the snow with his eyes closed." painting.</p>


      </canvas>
      <p> The above section did NOT appear within the canvas element at all.</p>
      <p> Per <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/canvas_intro.asp">w3schools</a>, <q>The canvas element is only a container for graphics. You must use a script to actually draw the graphics.</q></p>
